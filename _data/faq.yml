- question: What is your preferred work environment?
  answer: I thrive in collaborative environments that encourage innovation and continuous learning. While Iâ€™m comfortable working in both office and remote settings, I have a preference for remote or hybrid arrangements. I find that remote work allows me to focus deeply and be productive, while hybrid setups also give me opportunities for in-person collaboration and team building.

- question: What technologies do you specialize in?
  answer: I specialize in full stack development, with significant experience using PHP and Node.js on the backend, and modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Svelte, and VueJS on the frontend. I am skilled at designing and integrating REST and SOAP APIs, working with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, and automating workflows between systems. I also have experience with DevOps tools like Docker and AWS. I am passionate about building secure and scalable solutions that help people connect and collaborate more effectively.

- question: How do you approach team leadership?
  answer: I believe in a collaborative leadership style that empowers team members to share their ideas and take ownership of their work. I focus on clear communication, regular check-ins, and creating an environment where everyone feels comfortable asking questions or suggesting improvements. Mentorship is important to me, so I make time to support junior developers, helping them grow technically and professionally. When making decisions, I encourage team input and strive for consensus, but I am also ready to provide direction when needed to keep projects moving forward. I address conflicts openly and constructively, aiming to find solutions that benefit the team and the project. Ultimately, I see my role as helping the team align with business goals, stay motivated, and deliver high-quality results together.

- question: What's your biggest professional achievement?
  answer: One of my biggest professional achievements was building and leading the CCLE summer internship program at UCLA, which ran from 2011 to 2020. I developed a structured program that gave student developers hands-on experience with real-world projects, such as database management, caching strategies, API development, and web services. Throughout the years, I mentored interns through the entire software development lifecycle, supporting their technical and professional growth. Many interns went on to secure full-time roles in the tech industry. I am especially proud of creating a supportive environment that helped launch the next generation of engineers.
